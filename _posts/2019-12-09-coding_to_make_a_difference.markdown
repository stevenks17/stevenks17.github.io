   Alot of my decision to make the plunge to pursue a career in Software Development has alot to do with my experience in the technical space in terms of holding multiple positions at different companies as a Technical Engineer a Support Engineer and QA and Network Engineer. I thoroughly enjoy technology as a whole in every aspect as we continue to use it to innovate and achieve new inventions. An example of what I mean is media content in general this path started with cassettes and fast forward today using and specific medium to store content to listen at a later date is a thing of the past as we now just stream it to whatever device you prefer. Aside fromy my professional experience I have dabbled a bit in coding via modding video games as I have been and avid gamer since  I was 6 years old. These experiences have definitely emboldend my interest in programming as I believe it to be the building blocks for our collective future.
